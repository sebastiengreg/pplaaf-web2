Fadel Barro is the West Africa coordinator for PPLAAF. Trained as an investigating journalist, he is the cofounder of the Senegalese civic movement “Y’en a Marre” and one of its main architects since its creation in January 2011. Leader of a “conquering youth who turn its back on exile and defeatism”, Fadel Barro through his slogan “there is no foreclosed destiny there are only deserted responsibilities" knew how to make civic engagement a philosophy of humanist action which rallied the young people of the continent to open new possibilities. He inspired a generation of activists who find themselves today within the Afrikki platform, made up of around fifty citizens' movements and committed artists across Africa and its diasporas. 
The organization of the first Popular University of Citizen Engagement (UPEC) in Dakar in July 2018, helped consolidate and amplify the exchange of practices and experiences from these movements which, spontaneously drawing on the arts and culture, strengthen democracy and freedoms in Africa. Fadel Barro has been the Ambassador of Consciousness of Amnesty International since 2016.
