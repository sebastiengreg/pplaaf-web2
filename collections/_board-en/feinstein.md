Andrew Feinstein is a South African writer and campaigner based in the UK. He was a facilitator in the constitutional negotiations process that led to the first democratic elections in South Africa in 1994, when he was elected an ANC Member of Parliament. He served as a MP for more than seven years – on Parliament’s Finance committee, serving as Deputy Chair of the country’s Audit Commission and as the ranking ANC member on the key financial oversight body, the Public Accounts Committee. He resigned in protest when the Public Accounts Committee was prohibited from investigating a massive arms deal involving several European companies that was tainted by allegations of high-level corruption.
