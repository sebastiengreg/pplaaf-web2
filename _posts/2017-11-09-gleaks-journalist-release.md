The [Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project](http://www.occrp.org/), [Daily Maverick](http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/), [amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism](http://www.amabhungane.co.za/) and [Platform for the Protection of Whistleblowers in Africa](http://www.pplaaf.org/) have launched today an online facility for sharing a large data trove at the centre of an international corruption and money laundering scandal.

The #GuptaLeaks contain hundreds of thousands of emails and other documents evidencing how three businessman brothers, the Guptas, have “captured” political decision-making in South Africa, benefited from state contracts and allegedly laundered [billions of rands] [hundreds of millions of Dollars/Euros] offshore. The Guptas are friends of South African President Jacob Zuma and in business with his son Duduzane.

The scandal has reverberated internationally, implicating multinationals who facilitated or turned a blind eye to the Guptas’ allegedly criminal ventures. These include reputation management company Bell Pottinger, which has gone into administration, auditing firm KPMG, consultants McKinsey & Co and software giant SAP. Authorities in the US, UK and Dubai are reportedly investigating.

The Daily Maverick’s Scorpio investigative unit and investigative non-profit amaBhungane have led reporting on the story in South Africa. The releasing partners feel that the data needs to be accessible to journalists widely given the potential for collaboration to expose the full extent of the wrongdoing.

Qualifying journalists will receive password-protected access to the data. Apply here:
